                This is the home of the London Python Project Nights
                group and the place to find general information
                about us. Information about specific events can be found in
                the <a href="events/index.html">Events</a> section of the
                site. This is very much an open-source meet-up - if you have
                any input on either our site or our meet-up feel free to get
                improved, whether through attendance of our events, through
                the mailing list or on twitter, or through GitHub pull
                requests. All constructive input is welcomed, even if not
                accepted.

            London Python Project Nights' Statement on Diversity and Conduct
        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Happily, London's Python community is diverse and maintains a
                reputation as friendly, welcoming and dynamic.
            </p>
            <p>
                We trust that attendees of London Python Project Nights will
                treat each other in a way that reflects the widely held view
                that diversity and friendliness are strengths of our community
                to be celebrated and fostered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, we believe attendees have a right to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    be treated with courtesy, dignity and respect;
                </li>
                <li>
                    be free from any form of discrimination, victimisation,
                    harassment or bullying;
                </li>
                <li>
                    enjoy an environment free from unwelcome behaviour,
                    inappropriate language and unsuitable imagery.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We also make the following requests in order to foster a
                welcoming environment for new projects and their contributors:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    please choose a license for your project;
                </li>
                <li>
                    please contribute to a project;
                </li>
                <li>
                    if it's your own project make it clear what forms of
                    contribution are welcome from others;
                </li>
                <li>
                    if it's another's project please respect their wishes;
                </li>
                <li>
                    please offer any insights from your own experience, but do
                    so respectfully and bear in mind that the recipient of your
                    advice is free to disagree.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

                contact a London Python Project Nights organiser directly and in
                private. Any complaint will remain confidential, be taken
                seriously, investigated, and dealt with appropriately.

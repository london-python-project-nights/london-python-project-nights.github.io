            <p>
                This was the second episode, again kindly hosted at Skimlinks'.
                As with last time we started by making sure everyone had fed,
                and by discussing our interests, and potential projects.
            </p>

             class="img-small"/>
    </a>
            <p>
                This second session was slightly more focused with fewer
                projects on the board, which led to a more contiguous event.
                With fewer projects being worked on, more people worked together.
            </p>

             title="Group gathered with less populous board"
             class="img-small"/>
    </a>
            <p>
                With more people working together this gave an opportunity to
                pair program, a practice some were more familiar with than
                others, and it encouraged more communication within the session.

             title="Smaller group, more collaborative"
             class="img-small"/>
    </a>
            <p>
                All in all this lead to more getting done, and a deeper level of
                discussion at the end of the event. While I wouldn't want to
                avoid having the group grow larger, I shall be working over the
                next few sessions to capture this environment again, and
                ruminate on way to scale it.

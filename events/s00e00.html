                This was the pilot episode, hosted at Skimlinks' office just
                north of Old St. Being the first session nobody quite knew
                what to expect. As people turned up, we chatted about what
                we'd like to get out of the evening.

                As advertised, this was an un-catered event attendees
                were welcome to bring or order their own food and
                beverages. A few people had eaten before they arrived while
                others ordered the traditional tech meet-up staple: pizza.

                After a bit of discussion we wrote up some of our ideas on a
                whiteboard - this was intended to help people coalesce into
                groups.

                When the pizza arrived people continued to chat about their
                projects - Greg told Tim about how he'd been trying to
                contribute to the turtle module, not knowing that Tim is a
                Python core contributor. This lead to Tim and Greg spending
                their evening working on a related ticket.

                Given a face-to-face environment to collaborate on our
                projects, some of us went old-school, scrawling on notes on
                primitive sheets of dead tree - while much of open source
                goes on on-line, there are still merits in getting together
                to meet with your collaborators.

                While some people formed into small groups to work together,
                others chose to find temporary solitude in which to
                concentrate. Giving the space to work apart helped to make
                the interactions that did go on easier and more organic.

                At the end of the evening everyone discussed what they had
                done, some of the discussion was not only interesting, but
                also informative - people who had not been working on a
                project were able to contribute towards its ongoing direction
                by offering criticism and support for proposed implementations.
